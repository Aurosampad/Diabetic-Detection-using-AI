This repository is based on a project I made for one of our client's PhD thesis during my 1st internship where I have made a comparative analysis and statistical analysis of various Machine Learning classification models in predicting whether a person has Diabetis or not.The 2nd part of this project classifies the type of the Diabetis present in the person.
Considering the Random Forest model that performed the best in terms of Accuracy of all the models, I have deployed the models on the FastAPI Server and have containerised it using Docker.
