This repository is based on a project I made for one of our client's PhD thesis during my 1st internship where I have made a comparative analysis and statistical analysis of various Machine Learning classification models in predicting whether a person has Diabetis or not.The 2nd part of this project classifies the type of the Diabetis present in the person.
